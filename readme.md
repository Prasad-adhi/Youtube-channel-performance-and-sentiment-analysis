# Youtube Channel Performance and Sentiment Analysis

This project consists of a web page built on Flask that takes in the channel name of a youtube channel, extracts details about views, subscribers, likes and comments using the Youtube API and creates visualizations of view count variation and like count variation over the previous 'n' days. Additionally, sentiment analysis ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral') based on the comments under the video is also performed.

## Quick Start

1) Install all the packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Run the script using `python Flask_app.py`
3) Open the local host link generated to view the website
